# Exploring Efficient User Solutions for NYM: A Case for Thunderbird and Future Developments

Through extensive exploration and analysis of user behavior, it has been identified that Thunderbird emerges as the optimal and most efficient email client for NYM users. This robust platform is both user-friendly and meshes seamlessly with the current NYM user base.

In contrast, the ProtonMail Bridge, which was initially considered, appears to involve complex cryptographic operations and API. Additionally, its foundation in Qt makes it less desirable due to its intensive requirements. Furthermore, ProtonMail Bridge does not seem to offer substantial benefits to justify its complexity.

Research data indicates a significant proportion of users connecting to web applications like Gmail, further bolstering the case for Thunderbird. Considering its user-friendly interface, Thunderbird emerges as an excellent choice for both the existing user base and potential users in the years to come.

However, current capabilities for file transfers have limitations. The file transfer process tends to falter when transferring files below 100 KB, suggesting the current usage scenario remains quite limited.

A comparison between service providers and clients revealed interesting insights. While mixnodes can theoretically run on minimal hardware like the Raspberry Pi Zero W, a SOCKS5 client operating on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of RAM is noticeably slower than on a MacBook Air M1.

In future phases of development, the creation of a web application email provider could be explored. Detailed traffic flow analysis has provided a clear understanding of the system operations, paving the way for future advancements.

Moreover, the successful development of a multi-user chat using netcat adds another dimension to the achievements. This capability extends to sending messages from a simplistic web application employing WebSockets to TCP back to the netcat chat, underlining the feasibility of multi-user chat applications.

The application can be launched from a Dockerfile on any server, supporting both TCP streams and WebSockets, providing seamless functionality across web and CLI applications. Despite arguments that this approach could potentially undermine the purpose of the mixnet, the application ensures anonymity for users by obfuscating user identities and conversations, making it ideal for certain scenarios.

Another noteworthy experiment was the exploration of a solution akin to Magic-Wormhole. This involved tunneling over mixnet over SOCKS5 and testing how file transfers operate over another relay. This functionality could be easily enabled by setting up a relay host.

In terms of demonstration and user guidance, the proposal includes creating a user-friendly guide, potentially in the form of a Gist, that would help users navigate the email traffic from Thunderbird to major email providers.

Lastly, the revitalization of the nym-router is a significant project on the horizon. The model has been redesigned in the style of Pi-Hole, complete with custom design and branding. Depending on demand, over 100 units could be ready by Christmas. The advent of zk-nyms could transform it into more than just a personal gateway and client for the mixnet. Coupled with the integration of a Yubikey, this could herald a new era of secure, efficient communication.
