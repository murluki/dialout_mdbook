# DIAL0UT: Defying Global Surveillance, Championing Privacy
Inspired by Timothy Leary's iconic phrase "Turn on, tune in, drop out," dial0ut invites you to "dial out" of global surveillance. We offer an innovative solution that provides enhanced privacy and security to your digital communications and transactions. Leveraging the power of advanced hardware, we strive to ensure you stay connected without compromising your privacy.
## Modular Router: A Symphony of Power and Precision
dial0ut is set to redefine the networking landscape with a uniquely engineered modular router. The heart of our product is a powerful aarch64 board, the brainchild of open-hardware innovation. This powerhouse is capable of processing and managing data traffic with remarkable speed and efficiency.
The router's modularity allows for integration of multiple boards, each serving a unique function. This means that your router can evolve and scale according to your specific needs, ensuring that you always have the right tools at your disposal.
The Traveler's Companion: Mobile Access Point
One of the key components of our modular router is a detachable access point (AP) designed for users on the move. This compact module, equipped with LTE and a sim card slot, ensures you stay connected wherever you are. Whether you're working remotely or exploring new horizons, dial0ut is your trusted companion, ensuring privacy and security are always within reach.
Secure Enclave: Cryptography's Best Friend
dial0ut takes security to the next level by incorporating a secure enclave for cryptographic operations. This dedicated hardware component is like a vault for your digital assets, providing an added layer of protection for activities like cryptocurrency transactions.
Design Philosophy: The Zen of Cubism
Our design philosophy draws inspiration from the principles of Zen and the aesthetics of Cubism. Much like the tranquility and balance found in Zen, our product design strives for simplicity, functionality, and harmony. The influence of Cubism, with its focus on viewing things from different perspectives, is reflected in our modular approach, allowing users to customize their router from different angles according to their needs.
## Enhanced Privacy
dial0ut helps you dial out of global surveillance by localizing your network traffic, ensuring your data undergoes anonymization and stripping of metadata before it leaves your local network. This keeps your online activity private, reducing exposure to potential threats or surveillance on the larger network.
Minimized Attack Surface
Our modular router is designed to minimize the attack surface, reducing potential security breaches. The integration of advanced hardware and firmware ensures your network traffic is handled securely and efficiently.
## Greater Independence
dial0ut's approach diminishes dependence on external servers and services for anonymization. This means you can maintain greater control over your privacy and reduce potential vulnerabilities.
## Network Segregation
Our modular router allows for the establishment of a separate network segment, specifically designed for handling anonymized traffic. This added layer of security prevents potential compromises on the WAN from negatively affecting the confidentiality of your data.
## Who We Serve
dial0ut is designed for both individual consumers and businesses who value their digital privacy. Our dual-market approach ensures our product caters to a wide range of users, from the privacy-conscious individual to the security-focused business.
## Our Vision
Our journey has just begun. We're starting with OpenWRT as our foundational OS, but we have our sights set on developing our custom OS or integrating with robust systems like balenaOS or NixOS in the future.
