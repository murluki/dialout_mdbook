<p>Assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>[project] is: wireless AP that has pi-hole on it and nym-gateway to access nym mixnet over nym-socks5-client. All traffic from AP’s guests (Telegram, Signal, Monero wallet, Metamask wallet and Keplr wallet) should be routed through the nym-socks5-proxy running at localhost:1080 on the WiFi AP. Other traffic would be routed over the regular default gateway on the wifi AP. We are using Raspberry Pi OS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we dive into coding and implementing the project, let's first establish a solid plan. Here's a brief outline of our approach:</p>
<h2 id="table-of-contents"><a class="header" href="#table-of-contents">Table of Contents:</a></h2>
<p>Hardware and Software Requirements
System Setup
Configuring Raspberry Pi as a Wireless Access Point
Installing and Configuring Pi-hole

Future Enhancements and Roadmap
Task:</p>
<p>Hardware and Software Requirements: Identify all the necessary hardware components, as well as the Raspberry Pi OS and other software we'll need.
System Setup: Prepare the Raspberry Pi hardware, install the OS, and set up the development environment.
Configuring Raspberry Pi as a Wireless Access Point: Use hostapd to convert the Raspberry Pi into a WiFi access point.
Installing and Configuring Pi-hole: Install Pi-hole on the Raspberry Pi to act as a network-wide ad blocker.
Setting up Nym Mixnet Gateway: Install and configure the Nym gateway to allow our access point to route specific traffic through the Nym mixnet.
Configuring Traffic Routing: Setup iptables rules to route specific traffic (Telegram, Signal, Monero wallet, Metamask wallet, Keplr wallet) through the Nym-socks5-proxy and other traffic through the default gateway.
Testing and Verification: Check that the setup works as expected, all the traffic is routed properly, and the Pi-hole and Nym gateway function correctly.
Future Enhancements and Roadmap: Discuss potential improvements to the project and outline the roadmap for future development.
Next, we will begin with the Hardware and Software Requirements.
we are using 64-bit raspberry pi OS on raspberry pi 4, that means the arch is aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu. We will run the pi headless and without GUI.
Write step 2. and include the new information in the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="system-setup"><a class="header" href="#system-setup">System Setup:</a></h2>
<p>Given our Raspberry Pi 4 with the 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (arch: aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu), our system setup will proceed as follows:</p>
<h2 id="21-initial-setup"><a class="header" href="#21-initial-setup">2.1. Initial Setup:</a></h2>
<p>Download and flash the Raspberry Pi OS onto a microSD card using software like balenaEtcher.
Since we're running the Pi headless and without GUI, we'll create a file named 'ssh' in the boot partition of the SD card to enable SSH access.
Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect it to the network, and power it up.</p>
<h2 id="22-secure-shell-ssh-access"><a class="header" href="#22-secure-shell-ssh-access">2.2. Secure Shell (SSH) Access:</a></h2>
<p>Find the Raspberry Pi's IP address on your network.
Use an SSH client like PuTTY (for Windows) or the terminal (for Linux/Mac) to access the Raspberry Pi. The default credentials are:
username: pi
password: raspberry</p>
<h2 id="23-system-update"><a class="header" href="#23-system-update">2.3. System Update:</a></h2>
<p>Once logged in, it's a good practice to update the system. Run the following commands:

Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade</p>
<h2 id="24-configuring-network-settings"><a class="header" href="#24-configuring-network-settings">2.4. Configuring Network Settings:</a></h2>

<h2 id="25-disable-gui-optional"><a class="header" href="#25-disable-gui-optional">2.5. Disable GUI (Optional):</a></h2>
<p>Since we want to run headless and without GUI, use the command sudo raspi-config to navigate to 'System Options' &gt; 'Boot / Auto Login' &gt; 'Console Autologin' or 'Console'.
With these steps, our Raspberry Pi 4 should be ready for the next stages of our project.</p>
<p>After setting up the system, the next step is to configure the Raspberry Pi as a wireless access point. We will be using hostapd for this purpose, along with dnsmasq to handle DHCP and DNS services for devices connecting to the access point.

<p>Configuring Raspberry Pi as a Wireless Access Point:</p>
<h2 id="31-install-necessary-packages"><a class="header" href="#31-install-necessary-packages">3.1. Install Necessary Packages:</a></h2>
<p>Begin by installing hostapd and dnsmasq, which will act as our access point and DHCP/DNS server respectively.
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq</p>
<h2 id="32-configure-hostapd"><a class="header" href="#32-configure-hostapd">3.2. Configure hostapd:</a></h2>
<p>Edit the hostapd configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
Add the following (substitute your preferred network name and password):
bash
Copy code
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=Your_Network_Name
hw_mode=g
channel=7
wmm_enabled=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1

sudo systemctl start dnsmasq
Installing and Configuring Pi-hole:</p>
<h2 id="41-install-pi-hole"><a class="header" href="#41-install-pi-hole">4.1. Install Pi-hole:</a></h2>
<p>To install Pi-hole, we'll use the automated script provided by the Pi-hole project:
bash
Copy code
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.
4.2. Configure Pi-hole:</p>
<p>After the installation, access the Pi-hole admin interface via a web browser by entering the Raspberry Pi's IP address followed by '/admin'.
Configure the settings as per your requirements. Ensure that the Pi-hole is set to listen on the 'wlan0' interface (or whichever interface you're using for your access point).</p>
<p>With the Raspberry Pi now functioning as a Wireless Access Point with Pi-hole running on it, our next step is to set up the Nym Mixnet Gateway and configure the traffic routing.

Configuring Traffic Routing:</p>
<h2 id="61-sniffing-traffic"><a class="header" href="#61-sniffing-traffic">6.1. Sniffing Traffic:</a></h2>
<p>To verify that traffic is being routed correctly, you can sniff the traffic in multiple terminal windows. Tools like tcpdump or Wireshark can help monitor traffic.
Remember, in our setup, traffic from specific applications (Telegram, Signal, Monero wallet, Metamask wallet, Keplr wallet) should be routed through the nym-socks5-proxy running at localhost:1080. Other traffic should be routed through the regular default gateway.</p>
<p>Once we have the Nym services running and the traffic routing verified, our next step is to conduct a full system test to ensure that everything works as expected. Additionally, we will be looking at future enhancements and establishing a roadmap for our project.

point 7.3 - please provide a script that could do that routing</p>
<p>To achieve the desired traffic routing, we need to use iptables to create rules that direct certain traffic to go through the Nym socks5 proxy. Here's a general outline of a script that could accomplish this:</p>
<p>bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash</p>
<p>Define applications that should use the nym-socks5-proxy
apps=(&quot;telegram&quot; &quot;signal&quot; &quot;monero&quot; &quot;metamask&quot; &quot;keplr&quot;)</p>
<p>Set local variables
proxy_address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
proxy_port=&quot;1080&quot;</p>
<p>Flush all existing iptables rules
iptables -F
iptables -t nat -F</p>
<p>Loop over each app
for app in &quot;${apps[@]}&quot;
do
Get the UID of the application
app_uid=$(id -u $app)</p>
<p>Add rule for this app's traffic to go through nym-socks5-proxy
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner $app_uid -j DNAT --to-destination $proxy_address:$proxy_port</p>
<p>Add rule for other traffic to go through the default gateway
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner ! --uid-owner $app_uid -j ACCEPT
done</p>
<p>Ensure the changes persist across reboots
iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4
Please note, this script assumes that the applications are running under their respective user names and that these user names match the strings in the 'apps' array. If this is not the case, you'll need to adjust the 'apps' array to contain the correct user names.</p>
<p>Also, this script requires the 'iptables-persistent' package to be installed in order to save the iptables rules across reboots. You can install it by running sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent.</p>
<p>With this script, we've established the traffic routing needed for our setup. The next step is to test this routing by following the steps outlined in 7.1 to 7.4 of our plan. Additionally, we should begin to think about the future enhancements and roadmap for our project.
the apps are running on guests system not on the Wifi AP! It should do the similar as Pi-hole does with ADs but instead it routes it through socks5 proxy running port 1080.</p>
<p>I see, I misunderstood the setup; I apologize for the confusion. The iptables method I described would work for apps running on the same machine where the iptables rules are being applied. For the scenario where the apps are running on devices connected to the Raspberry Pi access point, we need to use a different approach.</p>
<p>We will need to install and configure a transparent proxy (like redsocks) on the Raspberry Pi to reroute specific traffic to the Nym socks5 proxy. Here's how we can do this:</p>
<p>Install redsocks:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install redsocks
Configure redsocks:
Edit the redsocks configuration file (/etc/redsocks.conf), for example:</p>
<p>bash
Copy code
base {
log_debug = off;
log_info = on;
daemon = on;
redirector = iptables;
}</p>
<p>redsocks {
local_ip = 0.0.0.0;
local_port = 12345;
ip = 127.0.0.1;
port = 1080;
type = socks5;
}</p>
<p>This configuration file tells redsocks to listen on port 12345 and to redirect traffic to the Nym socks5 proxy running on localhost port 1080.</p>
<p>Configure iptables:
Next, we need to configure iptables to redirect traffic from your specified apps to the redsocks port. This will likely involve matching on destination port or IP addresses if the apps use specific ones. Here's an example:</p>
<p>bash
Copy code
Flush all existing rules
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -t nat -F</p>
<p>Define the IP ranges or ports for the apps
app_destinations=(&quot;IP_or_port1&quot; &quot;IP_or_port2&quot; &quot;IP_or_port3&quot; ...)</p>
<p>Loop over each app IP/port
for dest in &quot;${app_destinations[@]}&quot;
do
# Add rule for this app's traffic to go through redsocks (and thus the Nym socks5 proxy)
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d $dest -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
done</p>
<p>Ensure the changes persist across reboots
sudo sh -c &quot;iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4&quot;
Please replace &quot;IP_or_port1&quot;, &quot;IP_or_port2&quot;, etc. with the actual IPs or ports used by your apps.</p>
<p>Restart redsocks service:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart redsocks</p>
<p>With this setup, traffic from the specified apps should be routed through the Nym socks5 proxy when they are connected to the WiFi access point. The next step is to test this routing to ensure it's working correctly. This involves monitoring the network traffic (as discussed in section 7 of our plan) and verifying that the specified app traffic is indeed going through the proxy.
how to get ranges of IPv4s and IPv6s of hosts for Telegram, Monero wallet, Keplr wallet and Metamask?</p>
<p>There isn't a straightforward way to get the full list of IP addresses used by these applications, mainly due to two reasons:</p>
<p>The list of servers they use can change over time.
These applications could use cloud services for their backend, which means they could technically be served from any IP within the large ranges owned by the cloud provider.
However, one practical approach would be to observe the network traffic generated by these applications and record the IP addresses they communicate with. You can use a tool like Wireshark for this:</p>
<p>Install Wireshark on a device running the applications.
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install wireshark
Run Wireshark and start a packet capture.
Open each of the applications (Telegram, Monero wallet, Keplr wallet, and Metamask) and allow them to communicate over the network.
Stop the packet capture and filter the results to show only outbound communication.
By inspecting the destination IP addresses in the packet capture, you should be able to compile a list of IPs for each application. This list can then be used in the iptables rules.</p>
<p>Please note that this method might not give a comprehensive list of all IPs used by these apps, but it should give a reasonable subset for a proof-of-concept project.</p>
<p>Once you've obtained the IP ranges for each of these apps, the next step would be to modify the iptables rules in the redsocks setup script to include these IPs. Afterward, test the setup to ensure the apps' traffic is being correctly routed through the Nym socks5 proxy.</p>
